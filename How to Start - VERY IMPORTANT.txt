How to start:

I think you now are lost, but here is how to start.

1. Double click on install_deps.bat  to install all dependencies.
2. Double click on  RunIT.bat to start using the tool

That's it!

There is more to explore, that's your mission.

I've just instructed you how to start with the first time,
you are able to upgrade the tool by doing your own packages or install our official packages by " install ", i advice you to check docs for more info.


Your assistant between your hands.
Happy coding!
