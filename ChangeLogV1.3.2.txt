RunIT – Tool Patch Update Summary V1.3.2
________________________________________


New command: p2pmsg
Version 1.0.0 - November 18 2025



Overview
- New command: p2pmsg — encrypted peer‑to‑peer messaging with host/guest handshake.
- Version updates: CLI banner and helper now show v1.3.2; package manager and version.txt updated.
- Docs: added a beginner‑friendly P2PMSG guide at docs/P2PMSG_GUIDE.md and linked it from the help menu and docs README.

p2pmsg Highlights
- Encryption: AES‑256‑CBC with per‑message random IV; symmetric key derived from a 16‑digit session code via SHA‑256.
- Privacy: messages are never stored; only minimal session metadata is cached in data/p2p_sessions.json.
- Handshake: simple UDP handshake (HANDSHAKE/HANDSHAKE_ACK) establishes the tunnel; periodic NAT hole‑punch keepalives (PUNCH) help maintain connectivity.
- Modes: Host generates a session code and listens; Guest enters the code, IP, and port to connect.
- Local testing: Guest now accepts "localhost", "local", or blank IP to default to 127.0.0.1, making same‑device tests straightforward.
- Cross‑network: Works on LAN using Host’s IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.x.x); supports internet connections with router UDP port forwarding.

Advantages
- End‑to‑end encryption: secure messaging using a session code‑derived key.
- Lightweight & fast: UDP transport keeps overhead low for near‑real‑time chat.
- Simple UX: interactive prompts guide Host/Guest setup with clear status messages.
- Privacy by design: no message persistence; ephemeral session cache cleared on exit.
- Flexible networking: local loopback (127.0.0.1), LAN IPs, and internet via port forwarding.
- Beginner‑friendly docs: step‑by‑step guide with troubleshooting for firewall/NAT.

How to Use (Quick)
- Host: run p2pmsg, choose Host, share session code and printed port.
- Guest (same device): enter session code, IP as localhost or blank, and the Host port.
- Guest (same LAN): enter session code, Host’s LAN IPv4, and the Host port.
- Guest (internet): enter session code, Host’s public IP, and the forwarded UDP port.

Troubleshooting (Summary)
- Same device: use 127.0.0.1 and exact Host port.
- Same LAN: use Host’s LAN IPv4; allow inbound UDP on Windows Firewall.
- Internet: configure router UDP port forwarding to Host PC; add Windows Firewall inbound rule; use Host’s public IP.
- CGNAT/strict NAT: some ISPs block inbound; consider requesting public IPv4, using IPv6 if supported, or using a VPN/overlay that provides public ports.
- Stable forwarding: if desired, set a fixed UDP port in commands/p2pmsg.py (bind to a chosen port) and forward it.

Related Changes in 1.3.2
- main.py: registered p2pmsg command, updated banner/version display to v1.3.2.
- commands/helper.py: added p2pmsg entry and version bump; help points to docs/P2PMSG_GUIDE.md.
- commands/package_manager.py: updated current version to 1.3.2 for consistency.
- version.txt: created/updated to 1.3.2.
- data/p2p_sessions.json: added for minimal session metadata (cleared on exit).
